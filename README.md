# BackgroundGenerator.github.io
BackgroundGenerator.github.io is an online background generator with both random and custom generation options.

This website is my second mini practice project using javascript and css.

Users have the freedom to select a custom two-color gradient background using the color inputs for left and right halves of the page respectively.
After selection, the vaue of the corresponding css-property (background) for the active background is displayed on the screen.
Users can then copy it and use it in their own work.

In addition to the concept idea, i have added few extra features which are as following:
1. The text color changes from light to dark and vice-versa depending upon the background color so as to improve readability.
2. The random button can generate random gradient backgrounds.
3. Added css-grid for responsive design.
4. Fixed the missing css-proprty for the initial background.
